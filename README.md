## Overview

### The challenge

To build a city project to the specifications and needs requested by the assignment

- adhere to the W3C standards
- support and use fully HTML 5, CSS3 and JavaScript
- display on a number of browsers like Opera, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari
- ability to display on mobile devices and multiple screen resolutions
- Good use of images and other multimedia objects.
- Page uniformity (consistent page display)

I personally challenged myself to build the project including plenty of Javascript components in attempts to make it look more modern. I do not think the website will win any design awards, and there are a few things that are slightly off and need tweaking, but it's functional and I believe it looks more than decent.

I also decided to build my own miniture library with seperate utilites and components that will be used around the website to streamline the developement process.
